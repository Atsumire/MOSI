There lived a squirrel in the old forest. The squirrel had a daughter, a squirrel, in the spring.

Once, a squirrel and a squirrel collected mushrooms for the winter. Suddenly, a marten appeared on a nearby Christmas tree. She got ready to grab the squirrel. The mother squirrel jumped towards the marten and shouted to her daughter: "Run!"

The squirrel took off running. Finally, she stopped. I looked around, but the places were unfamiliar! There is no squirrel mom. What to do?

A squirrel saw a hollow in a pine tree, hid and fell asleep. And in the morning, mom found her daughter.
