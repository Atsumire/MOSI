Shaggy gray clouds, like a broken flock of frightened birds, fly low over the sea. A piercing, sharp wind from the ocean sometimes knocks them down into a dark solid mass, sometimes, as if playing, tears and throws them, piling them up into bizarre outlines.

The sea has turned white, the bad weather has become noisy. The leaden waters rise heavily and, swirling with seething foam, roll with a dull roar into the misty distance. The wind angrily rummages along their shaggy surface, carrying salty spray far and wide. And along the winding coast, white jagged heaps of ice piled up on the shallows rise massively like a colossal ridge. As if titans had thrown these gigantic fragments in a heavy grip.

The dense forest, breaking off in steep ledges from the coastal heights, gloomily approaches the sea. The wind hums with the red trunks of the century-old pines, tilts the slender firs, shaking their sharp tops and showering fluffy snow from the sadly drooping green branches. Gray centuries pass without a trace over the silent country, and the dense forest stands and calmly, gloomily, as if in deep thought, shakes its dark tops. Not a single one of its mighty trunks has yet fallen under the bold axe of a greedy timber merchant: swamps and impassable marshes lie in its dark thicket. And where the century-old pines have turned into small bushes, the lifeless tundra stretches out in a dead expanse and is lost as an endless border in the cold gloom of the low-hanging fog.
